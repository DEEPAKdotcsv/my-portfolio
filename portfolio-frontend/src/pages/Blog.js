        Welcome to my blog â€” where I explore ideas at the intersection of data,
        technology, and impact.

        <h3>ðŸ”¬ Big Data in Genomics: Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>
          In my recent seminar prep, Iâ€™ve been diving into how large-scale
          genomic data is transforming personalized medicine. From variant
          calling to predictive modeling, the potential is staggering â€” and
          deeply human.

        <h3>ðŸ“Š Visualizing Impact: Why Dashboards Arenâ€™t Just Pretty Charts</h3>
        <p>
          Data storytelling isnâ€™t just about aesthetics â€” itâ€™s about clarity,
          empathy, and decision-making. I share lessons from building my thyroid
          diagnostic app and how user experience shapes trust.

          From the Missionaries and Cannibals puzzle to simulated annealing,
          these classic challenges reveal how constraints shape creativity. I
          reflect on how theyâ€™ve sharpened my algorithmic thinking.
